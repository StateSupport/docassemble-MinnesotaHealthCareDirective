  Part 1: Appointment of Health Continued
subquestion: |
  This is what you want your health care agent to be able to do if you are unable to speak for yourself.
  
  Your health care agent is automatically given the powers listed below in (A) through (D). Your health care agent must follow your instructions as you list them or any other instructions you have given the agent. If you have not given health care instructions, your agent must act in your best interest. 
  
  Whenever you are unable to decide or speak for yourself, your healthcare agent has the power to:
  
  (A)	Make any health care decision for you.  This includes the power to give, refuse, or withdraw consent to any care, treatment, service, or procedures.  This includes deciding whether to stop or not start health care that is keeping you or might keep you alive, and deciding about intrusive mental health treatment.
  
  (B)	Choose your health care providers.
  
  (C)	Choose where you live and receive care and support when those choices relate to your health care needs.
  
  (D)	Review your medical records and have the same rights that you would have to give your medical records to other people.
  
  If you DO NOT want your health care agent to have a power listed above in (A) through (D) OR if you want to LIMIT any power in (A) through (D), I MUST say that under "Power limitations:"
